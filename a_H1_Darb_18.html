                            For decades, Egypt has been a cultural hub for Egyptians- not only Egypt but also the Middle East along with the whole world. Egypt is the land of the greats, Tutankhamun, Naguib Mahfouz, Oum Khalthoum, and many more along the generations, which made Egypt witness a never-ending renaissance era in its arts and cultural scene.
                            <br><br>
                            Cairo, the Egyptian capital has always been full to the brim with cultural venues for music, film, art, and Egyptian folk.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the best cultural hubs in Old Cairo, where you can spend an artsy evening, is Darb 1718.
                            <br><br>
                            Darb 1718, a Contemporary Art and Culture Centre is an Egyptian non-profit organization founded in 2008. Darb 1718 includes a variety of indoor and outdoor spaces that host different art mediums and cultural events in the heart of Old Cairo.
                            <br><br>
                            The cultural center offers many workshops and courses, like: Pottery, Whirling, Sculpting, Percussion, Creative Writing, Leather Crafting, Cinematography, Script Writing, Crochet, and lastly Mosaic.
                            <br><br>
                            Going into the story of this cultural center, the name “Darb 1718” has the word “Darb” in Arabic which means “Path”, representing the path of change through art and culture.
                            <br><br>
                            The area where the hub is currently located, was originally a slum area called “Al-Mosalasa” -The Triangle-. That has been brought to the ground by the government and then Moataz NasrEldin, the founder of Darb 1718, decide to turn the land into the cultural space.
                            <br><br>
                            The architecture of the place was highly influence by its surroundings, the area around the place is very rich in architectural vocabulary, it has the historical religious complex and many other historical places. The founder and architectures that worked on the place, wanted to be in harmony with the context be it the graveyards nearby, or the churches and mosques on a larger scale. The colors and form, are as close as possible to the context, simple, and functional. The aim was to make it almost an unexpected oasis in the heart of the area. They also noticed that people started painting their houses with similar colors, which helped in adding identity to the area.
                            <br><br>
                            But this place faced many problems when it was first being established, specially from the community and people surrounding the area. The idea was rejected by the residents, who live close by and are unfamiliar with the activities that Darb hosts. As a result, the team made the decision to involve the community as much as possible. Women's initiatives where they can learn handicrafts and earn a living are being planned. Children participate in seminars where they learn about art and culture. As a result, strong bonds formed over time. Some even took part in the construction process and now work as construction workers.
                            <br><br>
                            Finally, this is place is a cultural gem, that we think should be more recognized and appreciated by the people and media. It’s a great portrayal of the Egyptian culture that deserves to be recognized.
