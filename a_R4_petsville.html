                            Most people who have pets would agree that their furry friends, be them dogs or cats, are considered as a part of their family rather than a product, a source of entertainment or an accessory. Despite that, many people still choose to buy their pets from a pet store instead of adopting them from a shelter. They may do so because they are searching for pure-breed puppies and are not willing to get an older or mix-breed pet, when in fact it should not matter.
                            <br><br>
                            There are countless reasons why adopting a pet from a shelter is better than buying one from a store, the first being the intentions of both places. Shelters are keen on saving the lives of the animals they find and taking good care of them until they are adopted by a loving family and brought to their forever homes. Shelters run mainly on compassion and love for these pets, aiming to give them a better life. Pet shops, on the other hand, treat animals like products to be sold rather than loving creatures with lives and emotions. They focus more on their own material gain and less on taking proper care and practicing compassion for these animals, which causes them to sometimes overlook the needs of these pets and occasionally treat them with cruelty or indifference.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, the money and donations that go to shelters are used to cover the expenses and needs of these pets, such as food, medication and veterinary care. Pet shops use the money they gain mainly to keep breeding or obtaining puppies in order to cage them and sell them for a cost. This causes suffering to more and more animals. Aside from all of these facts, the selling and trading of living creatures is inhumane and unethical. Adoption is the best option for those of you who are planning on adding a fluffy new member to their family.
                            <br><br>
                            A great example of a cruelty-free place where you can adopt a dog is PetsVille, a dog hotel and shelter located on the Cairo-Alex Desert Road near the Central Security Club. It is an open-air park where dogs are free to roam, run around and play together, rather than being locked in cages by themselves all day in a pet shop. They also rescue dogs and nurture them, later putting them up for adoption until they find their families. It is such a heart-warming place to go and watch your dog play with other dogs, or to adopt a rescue dog who is looking for a home.
                            <br><br>
                            All in all, an older, mix-breed dog will love you just as much as a pure-breed puppy would, and by adopting, you are helping to limit the cruelty and exploitation that animals face from the pet shop industry with every passing day. We recommend you give PetsVille a visit, whether you would like to adopt or if you’re just looking to spend your day with loving, furry friends. Most of all, remember: Adopt, Don’t Shop!
