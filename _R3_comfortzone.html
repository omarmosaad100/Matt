                            On the 21st of February 2019, the first Comfort Zone open mic even took place in the backyard of one of the founders’ home. Now, around three years later, the growth of their idea is clear, as they currently organize events that attract both performers and an audience, and have amassed an Instagram following of over 1,000 (@thecomfortzoneom). From singers to poets, people that play musical instruments, stand-up comedians and even photographers and those who express their art on paper by painting or drawing, The Comfort Zone’s goal is to give creative artists an outlet to express themselves and share their talents with others.
                            <br><br>
                            We spoke to Hazem Darweesh, one of the founders of The Comfort Zone, to tell us more about how they started out and how they got to where they are today.
                            <br><br>
                            What exactly is The Comfort Zone?
                            <br><br>
                            The Comfort Zone is meant to build a community and create a home for all artists and people to be themselves, express themselves and to feel safe while they get away from the stresses of life and enjoy a night of fun with people who share their interests. It is basically an escape from the restraints of life and a route that takes people back to their comfort zone.
                            <br><br>
                            How did The Comfort Zone start and develop?
                            <br><br>
                            I was on my way to an open mic event in Maadi with my best friend Farah Sultan, and at the time, most open mics were mainly organized in areas far away from where we live in Sheikh Zayed, so it was a hassle to get to these events. After we both performed and watched other people’s performances, we both got the idea to organize open mic events that are closer to the area we live and therefore easier to get to for us and those who live around our area. Two weeks later, our first event took place in Farah’s backyard. We got positive feedback on our first event, and that’s when we decided to create a name for our work and to develop it further into something bigger. We began to organize monthly events and were encouraged by the audiences to continue to grow and to proceed in what we were creating.
                            <br><br>
                            The COVID-19 pandemic and the safety restrictions that followed caused us to stop our events and go on a long hiatus, and Farah left the project to me as she couldn’t continue managing it with me. After COVID-19, we came back from our hiatus and are beginning to organize events again. We started choosing venues outside of Sheikh Zayed as well, which helped us to expand our audience, see new faces begin to attend our events, and reach people from different parts of Cairo.
                            <br><br>
                            What is your role within The Comfort Zone?
                            <br><br>
                            I am currently working with Habiba Hany, who is in charge of PR and social media, as well as a team of ushers that help throughout the events. As for myself, I take care of the internal affairs, issues and arrangements for the events and seek out venues for events to take place. I usually also host the events myself, and make sure the image of The Comfort Zone remains pure and artistic.
                            <br><br>
                            What kinds of events does The Comfort Zone organize?
                            <br><br>
                            We mainly began as organizers of open mic events, but we are currently trying to diversify the types of events we host. Aside from open mic nights, we have also hosted a Halloween movie night, an art gallery alongside the open mics, a photography exhibition, as well as collaborating with Basbousa Productions where we screened their short film. We are trying to provide an event where all artists can showcase their talents, voice and emotions and feel safe in showcasing their talents with The Comfort Zone.
                            <br><br>
                            What is the importance of The Comfort Zone in the art world?
                            <br><br>
                            One of my favorite things about starting The Comfort Zone is watching many voices and talents that were unheard and buried before came out at our events, and people were allowed to let out their emotions in a safe space in a creative and artistic way. Even those who were scared or too shy to perform were encouraged to beat their fears and insecurities and let their talents and shine in front of an audience by seeing other artists who feel the same way. I believe The Comfort Zone is encouraging hidden talents to emerge and share their art with others and that is the most important thing that we do.
                            <br><br>
                            What kinds of artists are able to participate in your events?
                            <br><br>
                            All kinds of artists are encouraged to participate in our events, whether they are poets, painters, photographers, singers, rappers, comedians, filmmakers or any form of art imaginable. We welcome all people and all forms of art and are willing to diversify The Comfort Zone as much as possible. There are different levels of how capable someone is in showing their talents and emotions, but we do not believe in such thing as a “bad artist” as long as it comes from within. 
                            <br><br>
                            In organizing these events, I have witnessed one of the friendliest and most unique atmospheres I have ever been in, and The Comfort Zone would not be possible without the community of artists that allowed it to grow and show its value and purity through their art, as well as people who helped build this community from the ground up. I am extremely grateful for The Comfort Zone family and community and everyone who helped, like Farah, Habiba, and other friends of ours who supported and helped us to organize these events.
