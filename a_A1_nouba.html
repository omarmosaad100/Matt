                            Egyptian fashion and clothing have always been an integral part of its culture. Practicality and comfort have always been an important part of Egyptian culture. Every nation has its own costume. Clothing represents people's heritage. It's a source of pride. One of the most unique and incomparable culture in Egypt is the Nubian culture.
                            <br><br>
                            Nuba people have their own dress styles that are different from the clothes commonly found in Cairo. Nubian style has a special admiration, and many tourists visiting Egypt spend a lot of money to buy such flashy items. The Nubian style represents the traditional culture and spirit of the country, and the unique patterns and colors represent peace and freedom. 
                            <br><br>
                            These handmade decorations play an important role in their nature and identity and can be found in many parts of the village, such as pots, musical instruments, scarves and even walls. The garments worn by Nubians often have loose sleeves and a neck without a collar, which is probably more suitable for hot and humid weather that must be dealt with in the desert.
                            <br><br>
                            Nuba women wear wide abayas and dresses with beautiful shapes and lines woven into colorful fabrics. Men mainly wear plain white Jellabiya with a scarf around their neck and a turban on their head to protect them from the sun.
                            <br><br>
                            Nubian women value jewelery. She often wears gold wherever she goes because it gives her confidence and status. Their jewelery also looks interesting and consists primarily of flat, round golden coins that form necklaces, earrings, bracelets and rings that resemble ancient Egyptian style. The patterns and colors they use are very attractive and very similar to Mandela art, the dresses look nice and comfortable to wear. Jewelery is abundant in its own way and serves as an integral part of the complete traditional costume. People who visit places like Aswan and Luxor often wear clothes that match the calm atmosphere and convey a Nubian-style sense of freedom.
                            <br><br>
                            When cutting and knitting abayas, the age of the woman is taken into account. This is because women over the age of 50 have certain styles, usually loose, with loose sleeves that are easy to put on and take off without accessories. The abaya comes with a wide black cloth called "chukka" that can be used as a blanket or pillow if needed. It is very similar to the men's costume known in West Africa as "Garnabova", but the color, emphasis and decoration of Garnabova are different. 
Nubian traditional costumes is not usually represented. Only few of Nubian people wear their traditional costumes out of their nation. Although they are extremely unique and beautiful but what really happens that Nubians don’t usually wear their own fashion, they start adapting the basic fashion which is “Cairo fashion” so they don’t feel so different.
