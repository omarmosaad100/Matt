                            Overwhelming experiences are quite commonplace for youths and adults alike in this day and age. And while one’s friend, parent or coworker would advise one to steer clear of these experiences for general peace of mind or comfort, some people, mostly youths, have been seeking one specifically overwhelming experience.
                            Which is thrifting in the heart of Cairo, in “Wekalet el Ballah” or simply known as “El Wekala” to its frequent clients.
                            “El Wekala” created in 1880, is located in Bulaq, and is a spiderweb of interconnected streets filled to the brim with clothes stands, shops, and sellers. The latter whom will quite repeatedly attempt to grab any passerby’s attention to come and shop at his stand or shop.
                            <br><br>
                            What each and every person who goes to El Wekala will find is always unexpected, but rarely disappointing. With an array of affordable clothes, usually second-hand, there is little room for a trip back home empty-handed.
                            And there is the word that has been so widely demonized that most readers would probably lose attention once reading, “second-hand” is a term used for clothes that are pre-owned, in other words, the exact opposite of fast fashion. And while anyone who encourages thrifting and wearing pre-owned clothes are adamant on continuing to do so, they’ve most likely heard at least one of these snarky comments in their lifetime:
                                <br>•	“That’s thrifted? But don’t you have money to buy real clothes?”
                                <br>•	“Aren’t you worried that that’s not clean?”
                                <br>•	“Come on be serious, you thrifting doesn’t make the world a better place or anything”
                                <br>•	“But what about the less fortunate people who shop there, why take what little they have?”
                                <br>
                            And these are all valid questions if they are coming from an uninformed person. 
                            Such a topic is so polarizing that people don’t necessarily try to understand but rather quickly establish an opinion on as to be seen as aware or cultured. And the truth of the matter is, environmentalists praise thrifting as a salvation from their biggest demon, fast fashion. While traditionalists shy away from seeing the imperative goodness that thrifting can bring to the environment, so they opt to use one of the digs previously mentioned.
                            <br><br>
                            But as public opinions may vary, what everyone can agree on is that while “Wekalet El Balah” has gained some recognition from youths the past couple of years, it is still widely underrepresented. And that underrepresentation is precisely the reason your mother or grandmother might scrunch their noses at you for buying someone else’s “dirty” clothes, or other trigger-sensitive people mistake your willingness to thrift there as thievery against less fortunate individuals, claiming that “because of the likes of you, prices in Wekala have been spiking and poor people won’t be able to shop, yes?”
                            <br><br>
                            No, in fact, the steady rise and fall of prices are a nationwide issue related to import-export and that big elephant in the room called inflation. To add to that, your willingness to thrift is helping. Not only the sellers, the economy, the decrease of fast fashion wastefulness, and most trivial reason of them all, the development of your own sense of style and individuality, but also, it is helping deliver the message that there is an unseen alternative that people and the media have not recognized. When you buy a pre-owned article of clothing, you are slowly disassembling the tightly placed taboos and constraints to fashion.
                            <br><br>
                            So you can choose to look cool, cultured, and authentic, while simultaneously diminishing the underrepresentation of a land of Egyptian and foreign clothes and fabrics with a democratized access to all who is willing to be a little informed and environmentally conscious.
