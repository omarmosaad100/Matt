                            As an Arab society, there is little to no knowledge surrounding the importance of therapy and mental health. Even those who know about therapy and its benefits still think of it as a luxury rather than a necessity. People often also frown upon the idea of therapy, viewing therapy goers as crazy, unstable, weak or unproductive within their communities.
                            <br><br>
                            However, despite the growing recognition that therapy is currently gaining during this day and age, there are still people that fail to recognize mental health as an integral portion of a person’s general well-being. Studies have shown that mental illnesses or discomforts can have a severe impact on your physical health, focus and concentration, and may also leave physical symptoms as well as the emotional symptoms that can already be detrimental to your productivity and human relationships.
                            <br><br>
                            Especially in this day and age, the growth of social media and the increased exposure to other people and their cultures, lifestyles and appearances can have a negative effect on a person’s mental health, in addition to the introduction of filters and other features that fit the social ideal of beauty that could make people become more insecure about their own appearance. Aside from appearance, the exposure to the lifestyles of the famous, rich and wealthy can make people become uncomfortable in their own lifestyles and social classes, while doubting their own capabilities to succeed and have the lavish life they view on social media.
                            <br><br>
                            Another factor that affects mental health in the modern era is the increased stress of the fast paced life we are now all subjected to. Most of today’s youth have witnessed many world catastrophes, including revolutions, a pandemic, and the added stress of day to day work and responsibilities that may add pressure to today’s members of society.
                            <br><br>
                            To add to all of these external factors, there are other internal factors that may cause mental distress to a person, including genetically inherited mental illnesses or a chemical imbalance in the brain that may cause mental illnesses and symptoms to appear in a person and affect their ability to function and perform basic tasks on a daily basis.
                            <br><br>
                            Because of all of these influences on a person’s brain, people should be keen on seeking therapy even without experiencing debilitating symptoms, just to keep their mental health in check and to make sure they are able to live peacefully, comfortably and practically, and to catch any early symptoms of mental illness and begin treating them during their early stages to prevent these mental illnesses from developing into something unbearable and to make people aware of their mental issues and able to deal with them efficiently and safely.
