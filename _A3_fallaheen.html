                            Fellah was a term used to refer to local villagers and peasants throughout the Middle East during the Islamic period. It is translated as "farmer" or "pawn". Fellah was distinguished from Effendi (the landowner class), but in this area Fellah is a peasant, a copyhold, or a co-ownership village. You may live. Others applied the term Fellaheen only to landless workers. Fellaheen have their own traditional costumes that they choose to wear due to their ethics, climate and traditions.

                            El Jellabiya forms the basis of traditional Egyptian folk costumes. It can be worn alone or with trousers, headdresses, shoes and other outerwear. Jellabiya has elongated sleeves and a triangular neckline. However, there are other versions as well. Kamis, it is wider with wider sleeves and is mainly worn by Fellaheen While they were working, Fellaheen lifted the Jellabiya skirt and wrapped it around their thighs.
                            <br><br>
                            An option is to wear traditional Egyptian trousers (serwal) under Jellabiya and pull the kaftan over it. Koftan is a long cloak-like striped garment made of semi-silk, cotton, satin, brocade and more. The sleeves are long and wide, with a sash in front called the hizan. In different parts of the country, you can find a variety of other outerwear that people wear on top of kaftan. For example, the “binish”, a dark fabric overcoat with wide sleeves and simple cut. There`s also the “djubbeh”, an overcoat with long sleeves and more intricately designed than the “binish”. Also, there is the jubbah, a long wide sleeved overcoat with buttons only halfway down the front.

                            Although the descriptions of each of these sound very similar, each one certainly has its own unique features. To top all of this off are three main types of headgear Egyptian men traditionally wear. Their purpose is usually to protect their heads from the hot sun, sand and other bad weather. There are skull caps, and turbans. Skull caps (or taqiyah) are small round cotton caps that are often worn under a turban.

                            Layered, light and loose clothing is a favorite of Egyptian women. Most of them are Muslims, so they tend to cover their entire body from head to toe. The traditional Egyptian women's costume is Jellabiya, the women's version of Jellabiya. Women wear it with baggy trousers, outerwear layers, headdresses, and shoes that are used as underwear. Jellabiya is a long-sleeved ankle-length robe. Women living in rural areas wear it as their main garment. However, in the city, women wear Jellabiya only indoors or as underwear. For outerwear, Egyptian women basically wear “tob sebleh”
Whenever anyone immigrates from fellahin to Cairo, they usually don't wear those kind of clothes anymore. They change their fashion and start wearing like the people who live in Cairo. The main reason out of this, is that their costumes are underrepresented, so they prefer sticking to the norm and wear like the majority.
