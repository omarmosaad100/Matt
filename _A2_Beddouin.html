                            As always, people wear warm clothing to keep your body warm in the winter and a cotton towel in the summer to get rid of this warm climate. This leads to the conclusion that seasons affect the climate and that we humans adapt to the climate. Different clothes for different climates. People living in different regions wear different types of clothing, depending on the climatic conditions and cultural aspects of the region.
                            <br><br>
                            Bedouins make their clothes from camel, sheep and goat wool. The clothing design is functional and fashionable. Traditional men's Arab outfits consist of long white tunics, sleeveless cloaks and unique scarves. The loosely cut tunic allows air to circulate, causing sweat to evaporate too quickly and dehydrate in hot, dry air slowly. 
                            <br><br>
                            A scarf or `kufiyya'is the most characteristic part of Arab clothing. It is held by a heavy coil of wool or "agal". You can wrap the edge of the cloth around your face or neck. It acts as a protection from the cold, a shield from the heat of the sun, and a privacy screen from the wind and sand. The rope shows the wearer's ability to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of a man. 
                            <br><br>
                            The woman is wearing a black robe on her chest. Her head and face are protected by a special shell called Burke and expensive jewelry. Their clothes are loose and protect the wearer from hostile elements. Clothing, one of the few personal possessions they own, is culturally important to Bedouin. Tradition stipulates that the deceased's clothing should be left in the tomb and adopted by troubled passers-by. 
                            <br><br>
                            In July 1917, while crossing El Houl, a barren plain near the Nefudh Desert, on his way to attack Aqaba, Lawrence observed: "It was a breathtaking wind, and as the sun went by and the sun rose into the sky, it became stronger. Around noon, half a strong wind blew, tearing my wrinkled lips. The skin on the face was rough. The grainy lips appeared to recede, exposing the shrunken eyes. "The Arabs pulled the scarf tightly over their nose and pulled the forehead line forward like a visor, but the slits were narrow and only loosely flapping”.
                            <br><br>
                            It can be seen that the customs, traditions and customs of Bedouin society are linked by some restrictions that prevent men and women from mixing and talking with each other, except to the narrowest extent. Therefore, color plays a special role in defining the social status of Bedouin women. The red color ruffles the Bedouin dress, indicating that the woman is married, and the blue color indicates that the girl does not yet have a virgin. Married and many young girls are more likely to go for an angelic white color.
                            <br><br>
                            Bedouin fashion is considered under represented, most of them don’t wear their traditional clothes anywhere else except their area. They get affected by the “Cairo’s modern fashion” although their costumes are overwhelming and beautiful, but only few of them choose to stick to their unique costumes although looking unusual or different than others.
