                            Upper Egypt is called Upper Egypt due to its height above sea level compared to Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, also known as the Nile Valley, is the region that represents the south of Egypt. Or the upper reaches of the Nile land in Egypt. This region, which stretches from the south of Giza to the north of Aswan in the south, the border with Sudan, and east along the Red Sea, represents the bottom of the map of Egypt. In Arabic, Upper Egypt is the height above the earth, from which the name Upper Egypt was derived, and the inhabitants of this area are called Upper Egyptians.

                            As for Upper Egypt, specifically in the governorates of Beni Suef, Fayyum, Minya, Assiut, Sohag, Qena, women wear a black robe outside the house that they wear over their domestic dress, and while Esna women wear clothes resembling the long municipal robes known as (kaftan), and in Beni Suef and Minya, women wear the “malis” in addition to another robe that takes the middle of a circle and is called “a flat.” The “burdah” is used in Assiut, and it is made manually of black wool, cotton.
                            <br><br>
                            With wide sleeves and loose fabrics, Jellabiya is an ideal choice for clothing worn by both men and women here in Egypt, and it is not surprising that it is still found nationwide today. Light, refreshing, incredibly comfortable and unobtrusive enough to be worn anywhere. Although slightly different from other Arab culture robes, Jellabiya has been a traditional choice for the mentioned governorates for hundreds of years. When worn over undershirts (kamis) and light cotton trousers (sirwal), Jellabiya is usually woven with lightweight cotton in the hot summers and a heavier weave of cotton or wool in the winters. A turban (`Emma) completes the look, providing protection from the hot summer sun and warmth when the weather cools. `Emma is also a symbol of status and authority and plays an important role in Egyptian identity. 
                            <br><br>
                            Jellabiya is worn in a very similar way by both men and women, but there are far more variations in the traditional designs worn by women, depending on which village or region the woman came from. .. The woman also wore a beautifully designed fabric that was dyed much blacker. Often decorated with scarves and jewelery, it comes with a special kaftan and wrap to maintain dignity. However, this has changed slowly since the 90's, with most women across the country abandoning the bright colors of traditional Jellabiya and instead wearing black dresses and abaya.
                            <br><br>
                            Upper Egyptians are underrepresented nation. Their fashion and style are only used in the governorates and areas mentioned in this article. Their costumes are not represented in Cairo, due to this they change their traditional fits so they can get into the modern style of Cairo.
